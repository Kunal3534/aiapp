# 💝 Valentine's Day Proposal for Shubhra

A creative AI chatbot Valentine's proposal disguised as a design assistant.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy to Vercel (Easiest - 2 minutes!)

### Option 1: Deploy via GitHub
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Upload all these files to the repo
3. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
4. Click "New Project" → Import your repo
5. Click "Deploy" — that's it!

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

## 🛠️ Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run locally
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── vite.config.js
├── tailwind.config.js
├── postcss.config.js
└── src/
    ├── main.jsx
    ├── index.css
    └── App.jsx (the main Valentine's component)
```

## 💕 How It Works

1. Shubhra sees a "design assistant" AI
2. She asks 3 design-related questions
3. Each answer has subtle romantic hints
4. After 3 questions, the AI "malfunctions" and reveals its true purpose
5. The big question appears: "Will you be my Valentine?"
6. The "No" button doesn't really work 😉

## 🎨 Customization

Edit `src/App.jsx` to:
- Change the questions
- Modify the reveal messages
- Update the celebration message
- Change the name

Good luck! 🍀💕
